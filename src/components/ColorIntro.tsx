        We chose this color palette for Email Phishing because the color scheme
        develops a harmonious palette that conveys dependability and
        professionalism (blue) with a dash of urgency and excitement (red). The
        light grey keeps the overall look sleek and contemporary while acting as
        a soft backdrop that lets the other colours pop.
